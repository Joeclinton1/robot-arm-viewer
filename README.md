# URDF Loaders OBJ Playground

This project builds on top of [gkjohnson/urdf-loaders](https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders) to explore low-cost robot arms right in the browser. It layers additional capabilities on the original demo so visitors can compare different arms, tinker with their kinematics, and walk away with exportable models.

## Highlights

- **Enhanced rendering pipeline** that sharpens materials, lighting, and shadows for a more realistic view of each robot.
- **IK-driven click-and-drag controls** so you can grab the robot end-effector and move it around while the joints solve in real time.
- **DAE export** for every loaded configuration, making it easy to pull a snapshot into other tools.
- **Auto-animations** that showcase each arm's reachable workspace without any manual setup.
- **Preloaded library of affordable robot arms** sourced from the community, giving newcomers a quick way to compare size, payload, and movement before buying.

The end result is a lightweight viewer that highlights what arms are available, how they move, and how they stack upâ€”without leaving your browser.
